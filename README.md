# CIA -Investigations
## Continuous Integration Activity

Welcome to a world were overconfidence is your worst foe!
Indeed, a program *running* on your laptop is not guaranteed to run somewhere else...

 But don't worry CI platforms have your back !

In this hands-on through several simple examples, you will see the usefulness of those services.

The following project allows you to explore such problems through very simple examples that should either:
* run perfectly on your local environment but fail on the CI platform.
* the opposite, which arguably is not really better ;)

You mission should you choose to accept it, is to have a green cross by the end of the class.

Will you be able to solve the riddle ? It is up to you!

P.S.: it is not the CI scripts that you should modify :D
