# The Grand CI challenge

Welcome to a world were overconfidence can be your worst foe ! But don't worry CI platforms have your back !

## CI Platforms

Indeed, Continuous Integration Platforms are more than useful, they can be life saving.
* Especially if your development environment greatly differs from your production one* 
... which will be the case 99% of the time.

** Think of where you want to execute rather than go blindly with your own setup **

## Production environment 

*Production environment should always be taken in consideration while programming as some libraries or functionnalities might not be available.*
In some cases, test that were running perfectly fine on your computer will fail, while on other cases the program will simply not compile.

## Root of troubles

While the origin of the problem can be obvious sometimes, e.g., Language version, Operating system, it can also be more insidious with problem originating from your compiler.


## Your turn
The following project allow you to explore such problems through very simple example that should run perfectly on your local environment but will fail on the CI platform.

You mission should you choose to accept it, is to have a green cross by the end of the class.

Will you be able to solve the riddle ? It is up to you!
